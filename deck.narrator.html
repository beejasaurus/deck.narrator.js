<!-- 
    Add a 'data-narrator-duration' attribute to your slides whose value defines how long (in seconds) to play that section of audio. The audio starts playing from the end of previous slide's audio. 

    <section class="slide" data-narrator-duration="2">
      ...
    </section>

    As mentioned, the audio starts playing from the previous slide's end position. Therefore, if the first slide is 10 seconds long, and the second is 15 seconds long, then the third slide will start playing at 25 seconds.
